Hi! I'm Rich.

I've worked with software for many years. I started working in Ops roles with titles like sysadmin, infrastructure engineer, and SRE. I've recently worked in Developer Relations, focusing on creating content, building community, and presenting at events.

I have a longstanding love for open source software. Nowadays, I’m most involved in the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community. I created a podcast called Kube Cuddle a few years ago as a personal project, and my guests have included [Joe Beda](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/joe-beda), [Kelsey Hightower](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/kelsey-hightower), [Whitney Lee](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/whitney-lee), and [Liz Rice](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/liz-rice). To find it, you can search for Kube Cuddle in your podcast app or listen [through the website](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/).

Before working in tech, I focused on communications. I was a theatre major in college, performed improv comedy, directed plays semi-professionally, and did a lot of blogging. Storytelling is a big interest of mine, and I think a lot about how best to inform and inspire developer audiences.

I'm currently doing freelance work, consulting, and advising. If you’d like to chat about me creating content for your company, giving you product feedback, or advising you on DevRel, please [contact me](mailto:hi@richburroughs.dev). I'm also open to full-time positions.

### Content samples

I very much enjoy writing technical tutorials. Explaining things to new users in a step-by-step format is a particular strength of mine. I’ve written many articles like this, including this introductory [vCluster tutorial](https://www.loft.sh/blog/intro-to-vcluster-tutorial), an intro to the dashboard for Kubernetes [called Headlamp](https://www.loft.sh/blog/kubernetes-dashboards-headlamp), and this tutorial on [chaos engineering with Gremlin and Squid Proxy](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-with-gremlin-and-squid-proxy).

I've also done some Product Marketing related work. Here's a [product announcement](https://www.loft.sh/blog/self-hosted-codespaces) I wrote for a new open source tool called DevPod, and [an update](https://www.loft.sh/blog/vcluster-in-2022) for an existing open source prokect, vCluster.

I’ve been presenting at technical events of different sizes for many years. I started that long before I began working DevRel. Some of the events that I’ve presented at include: KubeCon Detroit, [KubeCon Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNelGGFwxcY), Cloud Native Rejekts Detroit, [Cloud Native Rejekts Chicago](https://youtu.be/jSVWiecTeo0?si=opRowSfG5MxTsB-l), [Multi-TenancyCon Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZwB-ZOZl_s), [PlatformCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1_iTue9GZU), [Civo Navigate NA 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRsp1uv8vOs), ConfigMgtCamp Portland, DevOpsDays Minneapolis, the Idaho Kubernetes Meetup. and the Kubernetes Atlanta Meetup, as well as many others.

I’ve been podcasting since 2019 and conducting interviews is a strength of mine. I’m curious and love to hear people’s stories. The first podcast that I created and co-hosted was called [Break Things on Purpose](https://www.gremlin.com/podcast). I created my current podcast, Kube Cuddle, in 2020. In addition to hosting podcasts, I’ve appeared as a guest on podcasts like [Screaming in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxK1oD0nBtM), [DevOps and Docker Talk](https://changelog.com/shipit/42), [Ship It!](https://changelog.com/shipit/42),  [The Ardan Labs Podcast](https://ardanlabs.buzzsprout.com/1466944/episodes/11910719-from-improv-to-staff-developer-advocate-with-rich-burroughs), and [ADHD Nerds](https://adhdnerds.com/rich-burroughs-simply-adhd-and-a-career-in-tech).
