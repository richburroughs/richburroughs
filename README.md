Hi! I'm Rich.

I've worked with the internet and around software development for many years. I started off working in Ops roles, with titles like sysadmin, infrastructure engineer, and SRE. More recently, I've worked in Developer Relations, focusing on creating content, building community, and presenting at events.

I have a longstanding love for open source software, and nowadays Iâ€™m most involved in the Kubernetes/Cloud Native community. I created a podcast called Kube Cuddle a few years ago as a personal project, and my guests have included Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Liz Rice. To find it, you can search for Kube Cuddle in your podcast app, or you can listen through the [website here](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/).
