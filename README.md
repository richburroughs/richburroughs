Hi! I'm Rich.

I've worked with software for many years. I started working in Ops roles with titles like sysadmin, infrastructure engineer, and SRE. I've recently worked in Developer Relations, focusing on creating content, building community, and presenting at events.

I have a longstanding love for open source software. Nowadays, I’m most involved in the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community. I created a podcast called Kube Cuddle a few years ago as a personal project, and my guests have included Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Liz Rice. To find it, you can search for Kube Cuddle in your podcast app or listen [through the website](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/).

Before working in tech, I focused on communications. I was a theatre major in college, performed improv comedy, directed plays semi-professionally, and did a lot of blogging. Storytelling is a big interest of mine, and I think a lot about how best to inform and inspire developer audiences.

I'm currently doing freelance work, consulting, and advising. If you’d like to chat about me creating content for your company, giving you feedback on products, or advising you on DevRel, please contact me.
