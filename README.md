Hi! I'm Rich.

I've worked with software for many years. I started working in Ops roles with titles like sysadmin, infrastructure engineer, and SRE. I've recently worked in Developer Relations, focusing on creating content, building community, and presenting at events.

I have a longstanding love for open source software. Nowadays, I’m most involved in the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community. I created a podcast called Kube Cuddle a few years ago as a personal project, and my guests have included [Joe Beda](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/joe-beda), [Kelsey Hightower](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/kelsey-hightower), [Whitney Lee](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/whitney-lee), and [Liz Rice](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/episodes/liz-rice). To find it, you can search for Kube Cuddle in your podcast app or listen [through the website](https://kubecuddle.transistor.fm/).

Before working in tech, I focused on communications. I was a theatre major in college, performed improv comedy, directed plays semi-professionally, and did a lot of blogging. Storytelling is a big interest of mine, and I think a lot about how best to inform and inspire developer audiences.

I'm currently doing freelance work, consulting, and advising. If you’d like to chat about me creating content for your company, giving you product feedback, or advising you on DevRel, please [contact me](mailto:hi@richburroughs.dev).

### Content samples

I very much enjoy writing technical tutorials. Explaining things to new users in a step-by-step format is a particular strength of mine. I wrote this [introductory vCluster tutorial](https://www.loft.sh/blog/intro-to-vcluster-tutorial) for Loft Labs. Here is a tutorial on [chaos engineering with Gremlin and Squid Proxy[(https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-with-gremlin-and-squid-proxy).

I’ve been presenting at technical events of different sizes for many years. I started that long before I began working DevRel. Some of the events that I’ve presented at include: KubeCon Detroit, [KubeCon Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNelGGFwxcY), Cloud Native Rejekts Detroit, [Cloud Native Rejekts Chicago](https://youtu.be/jSVWiecTeo0?si=opRowSfG5MxTsB-l), [Multi-TenancyCon Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZwB-ZOZl_s), [PlatformCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1_iTue9GZU), [Civo Navigate NA 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRsp1uv8vOs), ConfigMgtCamp Portland, DevOpsDays Minneapolis, as well as many other.

In addition to hosting my podcast, Kube Cuddle, I’ve appeared as a guest on podcasts like [Screaming in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxK1oD0nBtM), [DevOps and Docker Talk](https://changelog.com/shipit/42), [Ship It!](https://changelog.com/shipit/42),  [The Ardan Labs Podcast](https://ardanlabs.buzzsprout.com/1466944/episodes/11910719-from-improv-to-staff-developer-advocate-with-rich-burroughs), and [ADHD Nerds](https://adhdnerds.com/rich-burroughs-simply-adhd-and-a-career-in-tech).
